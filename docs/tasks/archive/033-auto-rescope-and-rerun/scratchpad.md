## Notes

# 2026-01-14

- Commands: ls; cat TODO.md; cat docs/tasks/active/033-auto-rescope-and-rerun/spec.md; cat docs/tasks/active/033-auto-rescope-and-rerun/scratchpad.md; date -Iseconds.
- Notes: Added plan to auto-rescope manifest violations by recording rescope_required state, updating manifests in place, and rerunning tasks after expanding locks/files.
- Verification: `npm run build`; `npm test` (vitest).
