# Lessons learned — 054 — Spec traceability matrix and acceptance checklist

- What worked:
  - Matrix-style table keeps requirement → code → tests visible at a glance; README link makes it discoverable.
- What didn’t:
  - None noted; the existing tests already covered the mapped areas, so no extra drilling needed beyond the resume runbook.
- Follow-ups:
  - Consider adding a short runbook if we ever add a new validator type so the matrix can link to it immediately.
